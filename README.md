# Homomorphic Actors

## Using homomorphic encryption inside an actor system

This repository experiments with the possibility of running homomorphic encryption schemes inside an actor-model system.

## Getting Started

So far, the ability is limited. You can run the example which creates homomorphic keys inside the system using the [sids actor model](https://crates.io/crates/sids) library.

```bash
cargo run --example create_and_replace_keys
```

There will be more to come in future.
